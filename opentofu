In this tutorial, we will learn how to install & deploy a container using OpenTofu

Previously named OpenTF, OpenTofu is a fork of Terraform that is open-source, community-driven, and managed by the Linux Foundation.

wget https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/releases/download/v1.6.0-alpha2/tofu_1.6.0-alpha2_amd64.deb

or

create a docker container using OpenTofu:

lalka.tf:

terraform {
  required_providers {
    docker = {
      source = "kreuzwerker/docker"
      version = "~> 3.0.1"
    }
  }
}

provider "docker" {}

resource "docker_image" "nginx" {
  name         = "nginx:latest"
  keep_locally = false
}

resource "docker_container" "nginx" {
  image = docker_image.nginx.image_id
  name  = "tutorial"
  ports {
    internal = 80
    external = 8000
  }
}

tofu init
tofu plan
tofu apply

docker ps
